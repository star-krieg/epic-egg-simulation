#Epic egg simulation

This repo includes the notebook I used to generation epic egg statistics for Pokerogue's current gacha system. Epic eggs heavily gate dex completion because most exclusives are in this tier.

### Files:
egg_generation.ipynb - used to simulate epic eggs, outputs a pickle file that has the list of Pokemon and number of Pokemon pulled until eggsclusives are completed
egg_stats.ipynb - uses the outputs from the egg_generation file to generate a histogram and get stats for all realizations in the DataFrame

Thank you c4v for the updated epic egg weight file.
